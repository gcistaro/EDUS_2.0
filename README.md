This code can be used to propagate the electronic density matrix of an extended system up to HSEX level. It can simulate the interaction of the system with a (classical) electric field. \
The equations we solve are:<br />
   $`i{{\partial \rho(\textbf(k))}\over{\partial t}} = \Big[ H_0(k) +E(t)\cdot \xi(k) + H_{ee}(k), \rho(k)\Big] + i E(t)\cdot \nabla_k \rho(k)`$
